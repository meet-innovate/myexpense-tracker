# MyExpense Tracker

A lightweight web app to track daily expenses, set a monthly budget, and visualize spending by category.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no backend).
I built this project as part of my portfolio to practice frontend development and create a simple, real-world expense tracking tool.
